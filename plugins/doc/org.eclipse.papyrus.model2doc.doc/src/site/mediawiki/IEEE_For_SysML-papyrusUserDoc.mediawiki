=IEEE For SysML=
==Description==
This feature provides a template to generate the documentation of SysML Requirements according to the IEEE Recommendation ('''[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/720574 830-1998 - IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications]'''). 
Currently '''Papyrus-Model2doc''' only provides this feature for '''SysML 1.4''' and only allows to generate an odt file (LibreOffice format).

This feature has been though as a demonstrator of Model2Doc capacities, but it can easily be customized for your own application.

==Requirements==
*'''LibreOffice''' must be installed on your computer (read ''Model2Doc Installation'' chapter for further information)
*You need to install the model2doc feature called '''Papyrus-Model2Doc Papyrus IEEE Integration for SysML 1.4 (ODT format)'''
**This feature requires '''Papyrus''' and the Papyrus Add-on '''SysML 1.4'''

==How to use it?==
* Create a new SysML model as usual
* In the ModelExplorer View, select the root element of your model, then '''Right-Click > Create IEEE Requirements Structure For SysML 1.4'''
** This action applies the required profile '''IEEERequirementsDocumentation'''
[[Image:images/ieee/IEEE_Create_Requirements_Structure.png|frame|The menu to select to create the IEEE Structure]]
** This action creates several stereotyped Packages (The applied stereotypes come from the profile '''IEEERequirementsDocumentation''').
[[Image:images/ieee/IEEE_Created_Packages_Structure.png|frame|The created Structure]]
* Now you can create your requirements, but they must be owned by one of these created Packages:
** UserInterfaceRequirements
** HWInterfacesRequirements
** SWInterfacesRequirements
** CommunicationInterfacesRequirements
** FunctionalRequirements_Mode_1
** FunctionalRequirements_Mode_2
** FunctionalRequirements_Mode_3
*** NB: Your can create more FunctionRequirements_Mode_x package if required. Don't forgot to apply on it the Stereotype '''<<IEEEFunctionalRequirements>>''' and to configure these properties '''mode''' and '''category'''. in addition, you need to complete the provide DocumentStructureTemplate before launching the document generation.
** PerformanceRequirements
** DesignConstraintsRequirements
** SoftwareSystemAttributeRequirements
** OtherRequirements

Please notice, that the document generation only use the field '''name''' and '''text''' of your requirements, so it is better if you fill these fields.
Once you created your requirements, you can use the Document Template provided for IEEE.
* In the ModelExplorer View, select the root of your model, then '''Right-Click > New Document Template -> ODT - IEEE SysML 1.4 Requirements Documentation'''
[[Image:images/ieee/IEEE_Create_Document_Template.png|frame|The menu to create the Document Template]]
* This action creates the IEEE Document Template, and open the editor. If you created new Package in your model, you need to adapt the provided Template to your structure.
* From the opened editor, select the root element named '''Text Document Template xxx''', then '''Right-Click > Generate All (Structure + ODT)'''. 
** The created odt file will appears in your workspace inside a created '''output''' folder.

===Result===
The result is a LibreOffice document with the same structure than your SysML model, where the UML Package becomes titles, the '''Requirement#name''' becomes sub-title, and the '''Requirement#text''' becomes a paragraph.
