poi, poi-ooxml and poi-ooxml-schemas are avalable in orbit. However, there are two versions of the poi-ooxml-schemas 
the lite and the full version (see https://poi.apache.org/help/faq.html#faq-N10025). For the insert of file in docx 
we need the full version, named ooxml-schemas.

Since we need the full version of ooxml-schemas we can not use libraries dependant of it from orbit otherwith there 
are two diffente versions of the same code.
